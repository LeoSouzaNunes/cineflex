## About

The following features are available: 

* Select an available movie.
* Choose a time for you session.
* Select as many available seats as you want.
* Submit your purchase.

The main idea was to set the route flow using the react-router
library and explore react resources. There is some possible
future ideas to make a better user experience such as a comeback button
and multiple customer data at the seats session.
